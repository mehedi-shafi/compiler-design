## Using the `run.shell`

I have a little shell [script](run.sh) to make it easier for linux users to run any C/C++ code. The command is as follow

> `bash run.sh <file_name> <file_type>`

i.e. to run the `problem_01.cpp` try this

> `bash run.sh problem_01.cpp cpp` 

## Please note

> Many of the solutions could be more direct and having less functions. In my opinion I believe making functions for each and every small task or calculation is what it makes a true modular program no matter how small the problm is. 

> If you are a student please do not blindly copy paste the solutions. Try to understand first. Then try to implement yourselves.

> There is also scope of optimizations, adding more features, more cases to solve. These solutions are mere to make up the points that is asked more directly. So if you think it is failing at some points make sure you solve that. If you cannot solve that please put it as an issue in the [ISSUES](https://github.com/mehedi-shafi/compiler-design/issues) section.

> And lastly feel free to contribute. Addiing more problems and solutions to the repo is always welcome. Make sure to put a pull request. I will be sure to check back every once in a while.

> If you are helped even a bit help others. Maybe star the repo rather than just downloading. Cheers.
